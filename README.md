# Huffman-Encode-Decode
Huffman coding is a lossless data encoding algorithm. The process behind its scheme includes sorting numerical values from a set in order of their frequency. ... This is a method of reducing complex code into simpler sequences and is common in video encoding.

Advantage :
The Huffman encoding scheme takes advantage of the disparity between frequencies and uses less storage for the frequently occurring characters at the expense of having to use more storage for each of the more rare characters
